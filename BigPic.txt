- what we see when looking at a website, we see the rendered version of that website
--> when we refresh, we send a request to youtube servers asking for the latest version of this homepage 
--> it sends to you. you can look at the page source and see what the webpage actually looks like
---> it will be HTML, CSS, and JS 

- the browser will take that code and make the website looks like what it looks like

-HTML is responsible for just being the skeleton of the webpage 
-CSS is responsible for adding style. puts makeup, change size, rotate
-->HTML: nouns
-->CSS: adjetives 

-JS is responsible for adding interacrivity, adding life to the webpage 
--> when you go to youtube search bar and start typing, those lines where it tries to complete what you are searching for, that's JS's doing 
-->JS: how things behave
